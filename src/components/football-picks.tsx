          NHL picks v2 prices the published forecast, which blends the model
          halfway with the market. A moneyline is recommended when the
          published win probability beats the posted price&apos;s break-even
          probability by at least 4.5 percentage points with positive
          estimated EV; a total when the published total differs from the
          posted line by at least half a goal. A game without a two-sided
          price is No Play. Picks through October 9, 2026 (v1) used the model
          alone with the spreadsheet&apos;s thresholds of 13 percentage points
          and one goal. Prices come from the NHL&apos;s partner sportsbook
          feed (DraftKings and FanDuel), the better of the two, and must be
          dated within 24 hours of publication. Each pick risks 1 unit; the
          fractional Kelly stake the sheet computed is shown for reference
          only. A moved, postponed or cancelled game voids its pick; totals
          push on the line; there are no moneyline ties. Estimated EV does not
          establish a real betting advantage.

          NFL picks v5 requires the priced line to sit at least 2.0 points
          beyond the price&apos;s break-even line, plus positive estimated EV.
          Spreads are priced from the published blended margin, totals from
          the published total, and moneylines from the market margin moved 0.2 of
          the way toward the pure model, with fixed dispersions of 12.82
          points for margins and 13.28 for totals. If fewer than 5 picks
          qualify in a week, the highest-edge positive-EV offers are promoted
          and recorded as volume-floor picks. Each pick risks 1 unit.
          Prices require an opposing quote, an exact kickoff, a verified game
          match, an explicitly configured available bookmaker, and an update
          within one hour. Schedule receipts must be within 24 hours,
          expected-QB depth charts within 48 hours, and the forecast within
          seven days. The underlying QB identity must also be dated within 48
          hours. Missing source receipts or expected QBs block a pick. Non-QB
          injuries are not modeled and remain flagged; this is not comprehensive
          injury clearance. Confirmed cancellations, postponements, and changed
          kickoffs void the original contract. Unconfirmed missing games stay
          pending. Moneyline ties are void; spread and total pushes return the
          stake. Margin probabilities use discrete key-number margins and
          total probabilities use integer scores. Historical calibration is
          diagnostic, not a publication gate. Estimated EV does not establish a
          real betting advantage. There are no additional exposure caps.

          CFB research picks v11 use fresh paired bookmaker moneylines, remove
          each book&apos;s vig, and take the median market probability. Its
          equivalent margin receives 80% weight and the pure model margin 20%;
          the blended margin determines win probability. Moneylines need positive
          estimated EV and at least 2.0 probability-equivalent points of edge;
          they cannot be promoted to fill the weekly quota. Spreads blend 20%
          model/history with 80% frozen market margin and apply development-fitted
          football key-number weights, with 15.35-point dispersion. Totals retain
          the published 50/50 blend and 15.93-point dispersion. The 15-pick research target
          can promote positive-EV spreads and totals only. Each market is capped
          at half the available exploratory slots, rounded up, after shortlisting.
          Capped slots stay empty; qualified picks are unchanged. These exploratory picks
          are labeled and evaluated separately from edge-qualified picks. Each pick records
          its policy and probability source; earlier picks retain their original
          rules and prices. Prices need a fresh opposing quote, matching
          kickoff, and verified game identity. Incomplete inputs remain No Play.
          Each pick uses one research unit. Multiple picks on the same game
          have correlated outcomes and their shared exposure is flagged.
          Pushes return the stake and moneyline ties are void. Recommendations
          remain active for research; estimated edges are not validated profits.
