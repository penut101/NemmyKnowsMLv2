        Every prediction below was made walking forward through each season with
        only the data available at the time, then frozen. They come from the
        pure model with no market blend, so they are historical stand-ins for
        the model&apos;s own skill, not for the published line. The market benchmark
        is the closing spread: the strongest public forecast of a game&apos;s
        margin. Beating it consistently is rare, and the model is measured
        against it, not against a naive baseline.

        Bias is the mean signed error of the model&apos;s home margin: positive
        means the model leans toward home teams. The published line and the
        in-game projections lean on the market precisely because the closing
        line remains the better pregame forecast.
