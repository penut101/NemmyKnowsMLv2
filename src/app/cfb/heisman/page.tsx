        A weekly Heisman Trophy forecast in two boards that are meant to
        disagree. The value board measures what
        a player&apos;s plays were worth in points above a replacement at his
        position, adjusted for every defense and offense he faced. The Heisman
        board forecasts how the voters will actually rank the candidates, fit
        on sixteen years of ballots. The gap between them is the story.
